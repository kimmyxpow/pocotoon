This is a simple project I made to learn web scraping using Puppeteer. It scrapes manhwa data (like titles, chapters, and images) from websites for educational purposes only. I'm just experimenting with Puppeteer and Bun to understand how they work together.

## What It Does

-   Scrapes manhwa info and images from a website (e.g., Solo Leveling).
-   Saves the data to a JSON file and downloads images locally.
-   Runs weekly on GitHub Actions (just for fun).

## Tools Used

-   **Puppeteer**: For scraping web pages.
-   **Bun**: A fast JavaScript runtime I wanted to try out.
-   **Axios**: For downloading images.

## Notes

-   This is purely for learning and not for any commercial use.
-   I don’t own any of the content being scraped—it’s just practice!
-   If you’re curious, feel free to check the code and play around with it.

## How to Run

1. Install Bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
2. Install dependencies: `bun install`
3. Run it: `bun install.ts`

That’s it! Just a little project to mess around with scraping.
